I am a Kotak AI undergraduate researcher at the **Indian Institute of Science**, working on graph representation learning under the guidance of [Punit Rathore](https://www.vistalabiisc.com/P_portfolio) and [Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/). I am also a **visiting** student researcher at the [Graph and Geometric Learning Lab](https://graph-and-geometric-learning.github.io/), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), working under [Rex Ying](https://cs.stanford.edu/~rexy/) along with [Menglin Yang](https://yangmenglinsite.github.io/). I graduated in April 2025 with a **Bachelor of Technology** in **Computer Science and Engineering** from the _Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam_, where my Bachelor's thesis focused on _Federated Learning with Dynamic Graphs_. 

I primarily work with **Graph Neural Networks**, concentrating on both theoretical research and practical applications using large-scale transactional graphs. Recently, I have been extensively exploring **representation learning with [sheaves](https://www.jakobhansen.org/publications/gentleintroduction.pdf)** and LLMs for **time series** data.
