I am a **visiting** student researcher at the [Graph and Geometric Learning Lab](https://graph-and-geometric-learning.github.io/), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rex Ying](https://cs.stanford.edu/~rexy/) along with [Dr. Menglin Yang](https://yangmenglinsite.github.io/). My research mainly focuses on **geometric and graph representation learning**, particularly **Hyperbolic foundation models**.

Previously, I interned as a Kotak AI undergraduate research fellow at [VISTA Lab](https://www.vistalabiisc.com/), **Indian Institute of Science**, where I worked on large-scale data mining and graph and sheaf representation learning. I completed by **Bachelor of Technology** in **Computer Science and Engineering** at Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Kottayam (May 2025).
